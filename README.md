# BatteryButtonLevel
BatteryButtonLevel (February 28, 2020) AJT 2020

Create an app that displays an ImageView and plus and minus buttons, as shown below. The ImageView contains a level list drawable that is a battery level indicator. Tapping the plus or minus button changes the level of the indicator.
Use the battery icons from the Vector Asset Studio to represent 7 different values for the battery level.

The app should have the following properties:
 - The plus button increments the level, causing the battery indicator to appear more full.
 - The minus button decrements the level, causing the indicator to empty one level.

 Other:
  - This project showed me that I can't make all my own, with the levels being leveled 0 to 6, but I was doing 1 to 7.
  - Our class really underestimated the time we need.
